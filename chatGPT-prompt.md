Help me design a short, but clear prompt for generating a front-end for a todo app. The tech stack should be NextJS. I want to be able to add a postgresSQL database and a backend in the future, so in the prompt I want to make sure that we can prepare the way our files are structured. The minimal requirements for this todo app should be adding, editing and deleting a todo. I also want the todo's to have a certain priority. Since I will add the back-end later it should still function, but with dummy data. How should such a prompt look like? Be specific. If anything is unclear about my requirements, please tell me.
