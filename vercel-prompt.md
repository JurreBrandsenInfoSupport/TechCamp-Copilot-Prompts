Generate a front-end for a todo app using Next.js (latest version with App Router).

**Requirements:**

- The app should allow users to add, edit, and delete todos.
- Use React functional components and TypeScript.
- Use dummy data (in-memory state) for todos, but structure the code so that switching to a backend API and a PostgreSQL database later will be straightforward.
- Organize the code with clear separation between UI components, data access logic (e.g., a `services` or `lib` folder for data fetching/mutation), and page components.
- Prepare for me to use FastAPI as a back-end in the future
- The UI can be creative
- Include comments in the code where future backend integration would occur.
- Provide clear instructions for running the app locally.

**Deliverables:**

- All relevant code files (pages, components, services, styles).
- A suggested folder structure.
- Instructions for running the app.
